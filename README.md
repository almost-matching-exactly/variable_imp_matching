# Variable Importance Matching
Code for the *Variable Importance Matching* paper.

## Usage
This code can be used to run the variable important matching (`VIM`) method and
reproduce the results in the paper. To use, follow the steps below:
1. Clone this repo.
2. Create a conda environment using the `environment.yml` and activate it.
3. Install remaining dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file using pip.
4. Add the `variable_imp_matching/` folder to your `PYTHONPATH`.
5. See further details in the `Experiments/README.md` on which scripts to run to reproduce the results in the paper.
