# Variable Importance Matching
Code for the *Variable Importance Matching* paper.

## Usage
This code can be used to run the variable important matching (`VIM`) method and
reproduce the results in the paper. To use, follow the steps below:
1. Clone this repo
2. Use the `environment.yml` or `requirements.txt` file to install dependencies.
3. Add the `variable_imp_matching/` folder to your `PYTHONPATH`.
4. See further details in the `Experiments/README.md` on which scripts to run to reproduce the results in the paper.
